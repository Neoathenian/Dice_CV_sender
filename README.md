# Job_scraping
This is an old project I made like a year ago and IÂ´ve just updated it.

The goal of this project is simply to send CVs to as many people as possible in dice. (SendCV files)
The Dice.py is me trying to see what people care about in the Dice website and I even made a little csv documenting it (sentences.csv)
